## Logging all your future hikes, in one easy location. 
This is an application for logging your completed hikes with additional information about that hike. I came up with this idea because I love the outdoors and all the activities that come with it, especially hiking the Colorado mountains. After completing an excess amount of hikes, you tend to forget the details of each hike; such as, the date, the time, the distance it required, the weather conditions, or additional experiences that occurred. These hikes are good memories/experiences that avid hikers like myself wouldn't want to forget the details of or even just the overall hike. This application provides you the ability to successfully log every detail of the experience without ever having to worry about forgetting with time, or incorrectly providing another person with false information about a hike they're considering enduring. I believe everyone that shares this passion with me would love to use this application for the same result that I'm pursuing.
